# Brainstorm & Project Recap

## ðŸŒ€ What We Explored

We participated in a crypto-focused workshop, but tonight's session centered on AI and group collaboration. Our goal was to brainstorm ideas for a product that combines blockchain and AI. We asked for project suggestions that would be both innovative and feasible.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal or Focus

We aimed to generate creative ideas for a workshop project that incorporates both blockchain and AI.

## ðŸŒ± Raw Ideas List

- Decentralized AI Model Marketplace
- AI-Powered Reputation System for DAOs
- On-Chain AI Insurance
- AI-Powered NFT Verifier
- Decentralized Prompt Training Playground
- AI Voting Assistant for DAOs
- On-Chain AI-Powered Content Curation Bot
- Crypto Wallet Sentiment Analyzer
- Blockchain-Based AI-Generated Art Game
- AI-Powered Smart Contract Auditor Bot
- AI Wallet Name Generator

## ðŸ”¥ Favorite Ideas

- AI-Powered Smart Contract Auditor Bot
- AI-Powered Reputation System for DAOs

## ðŸªž Reflections

AI generated ideas rapidly, including options we hadnâ€™t considered. However, the initial suggestions were very technical, so we asked for ideas with physical components (e.g., fashion or fitness), resulting in:

- AI-Powered NFT Fashion Drops
- Blockchain-Based AI Fitness Challenge Tracker
- Proof-of-Workout NFT Generator
- AI-Curated Outfit Styler with On-Chain Closet
- Decentralized Smart Mirror Companion

## ðŸ›¤ Possible Next Steps

Trip is familiar with Bolt for app generation, so we planned to start there.

Next, we asked ChatGPT to create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for our top idea.

# Project: AI-Powered Smart Contract Auditor Bot

## ðŸš€ What We Built

We prompted ChatGPT to create a PRD for an AI-Powered Smart Contract Auditor Botâ€”a web application where users upload smart contracts for instant AI-generated audits. The PRD was fed into bolt.new to generate a prototype.

**PRD Summary: SmartAudit AI**

- **Description:**  
  A web app for uploading Solidity smart contracts and receiving instant AI-generated audit reports highlighting security risks, bad practices, and optimization suggestions. Optionally, results can be stored on-chain for public trust.

- **Key Features:**
  - Smart Contract Upload (.sol file or pasted code)
  - Syntax validation and linting
  - AI-Powered Audit (vulnerability detection, recommendations, code quality scoring)
  - Structured Audit Report (risk level, issues, fixes, best practices, overall score)
  - Example Contracts for demo/testing
  - (Future) Save Audit Report to Blockchain as NFT or log (with metadata)

- **User Flow:**
  - Landing Page: Welcome, upload option, example contracts
  - Audit Page: Upload/paste, submit, loading spinner
  - Results Page: Collapsible audit report, download/copy options, try another contract

- **Assumptions:**
  - Uses GPT-4 for code analysis
  - No contract execution in prototype
  - No user login for MVP

**Example Input (Solidity Contract):**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SimpleBank {
    mapping(address => uint) balances;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function withdraw(uint amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient funds");
        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed.");
        balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    }
}
```

**Example Output (AI Audit Report):**

- **Risk Level:** ðŸ”´ High
- **Issues Found:**
  - Reentrancy Vulnerability (`withdraw` function)  
    - *Fix:* Move `balances[msg.sender] -= amount;` before the call.
  - Lack of Events  
    - *Fix:* Add events for `deposit()` and `withdraw()`.
- **Overall Score:** 62 / 100
- **Suggestions:**  
  - Add SafeMath for overflow protection (if using  "AI acted like a mirror that exaggerated our first instincts. Best results came when we challenged its suggestions, not when we just accepted them
